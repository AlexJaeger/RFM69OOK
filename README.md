# RFM69OOK

This project is an attempt to create a general OOK transceiver library, primarily for LowPowerLab's Moteino (http://lowpowerlab.com/moteino/). It should also work in many other Arduino derivatives that make use of Hope RF's RFM69 radio transceiver modules.

OOK sampling code and a complete decoding example for a cheap weather station temperature transmitter is included.
